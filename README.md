# Go To Line (plus!) package
Move the cursor to a relative or specific line in the editor using <kbd>ctrl-g</kbd>.

Enter a \<row\>:\<column\> or \<row\> (positive moves down, negative moves up) and add a 'l' as a prefix to jump to a literal line.

Usage was meant with [relative-numbers](https://atom.io/packages/relative-numbers).

Basically a minor edit of the [go-to-line](https://github.com/atom/go-to-line) package.
